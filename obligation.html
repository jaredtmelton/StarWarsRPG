<h1>Obligation</h1>
<table border=1 width=900>
<tr>
<td><p>Your character's Obligation is some remnant of their life before the campaign,
    which may continue to affect them. Choose an Obligation (or roll randomly)
    from the table below. Note the Obligation on your character sheet, and try
    to elaborate on it in your background story. The amount of your starting Obligation
    will depend on the number of PCs in the party.</p>
  <p>Before each session, the GM
      will make a roll to determine whose Obligation (if anyone) is activate
    during the session. I usually pre-roll this at home, and include the results
    in your write-ups. If nobody's Obligation is active for the session, then
    there is no effect. If one of the PC's does have an active Obligation, then
    the
    GM will let each player know how they are affected. Typically, the PC whose
    Obligation
      is active will have -2 Strain Threshold, and the other party members will
    have -1 Strain Threshold. Sometimes, there will also be a narrative effect.
    For
      example, if your &quot;Bounty&quot; Obligation is active, a bounty hunter may show
    up to collect you.</p>
  <p>For more information about Obligation, see pages 38-43 of the <a href="EotE%20Core%20Rulebook.pdf">Edge
      of the Empire CRB</a>.</p></td>

<tr><td><p><strong>Duty:</strong> If you're planning on taking a Career form
      Age of Rebellion, then you can take Duty,
      as outlined in the <a href="http://imadeyoursite.com/ageofrebellion/AoE Core Rulebook.pdf">Age
      of Rebellion CRB</a>. This will only come into play if you're party ends
      up working for the Rebel Alliance.</p>
  <p><strong>Morality:</strong> If you're planning on taking a Career from Force and Destiny,
    then you will need to take Morality, as outlined in the <a href="http://imadeyoursite.com/forceanddestiny/FaD Core book.pdf">Force
