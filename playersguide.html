<tr>
<td><p>One of the major strengths of Dungeons & Dragons is the Player's Handbook,
    which allows each player to possess their own copy of the rules that govern
    their character, without requiring them to invest in the larger set of information
    that is only needed by the DM. Star Wars, like most other RPGs that I have
    run into, uses an all-encompassing Core Rulebook (CRB for short). While I
    don't expect any player to read the CRB from cover-to-cover, you will need
    to have
    a basic grasp of game mechanics in order to build your character and begin
    playing. This guide is not intended to fully replace the CRB, but it should
    be a helpful starting point.</p>
  <p>This guide will also contain any House Rules that are relevant to our campaign.

    This link is a quick introduction to Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars RPG
    system, geared toward explaining what makes it different from Dungeons & Dragons
    (and other d20-based games). Since everyone in our group has played D&D,
    I didn't bother doing a full write-up on how roleplaying games work in general.
    Anyone
    who played in my previous campaign should skip this part, unless you're looking
    for a refresher on the basics.</p>

<tr><th><h3>House Rules</h3></th></tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Fantasy Flight Games makes 3 different
      thematic CRBs for Star Wars, each with its own line of expansion books.
    <a href="EotE%20Core%20Rulebook.pdf">Edge of
    the Empire</a> focuses on life in the Outer
        Rim of the galaxy, and allows players to be a variety of fringe-type
    characters such as bounty hunters, smugglers, and colonists (Imagine Firefly
    with a
        Star Wars backdrop). <a href="http://imadeyoursite.com/ageofrebellion/AoE Core Rulebook.pdf">Age
        of Rebellion</a> is all about being a member of
    the Rebel Alliance and fighting
        against the
        Empire.
        <a href="http://imadeyoursite.com/forceanddestiny/FaD Core book.pdf">Force
        and Destiny</a> is all about playing the part of a Force User. I want
    players to be able to pull their character creation options from all 3 games,
    so
      I have had to tweak a few of the rules. <strong>Please read this section, even
        if you have played before.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Character Creation House Rules:</strong></p>  
  <p>1. Players may choose any playable <a href="species.pdf">Species</a> and <a href="careers.html">Career</a>    from
    any of the 3 games, including options from the CRBs and the expansion books.</p>
  <p>2. All characters must choose an Obligation, per the rules in <a href="EotE%20Core%20Rulebook.pdf">Edge
      of the Empire</a>. The starting Obligation score is based on the number
      of players in the campaign. Assuming 5 players, starting score will be
      10. Extra Obligation
    may be taken in exchange for additional starting XP or Credits, also covered
    in
    the Edge
    of the Empire
    rules.</p>
  <p>3. Any character who starts as a Force Sensitive character (or who becomes
    Force Sensitive later on) must choose a Morality, per the rules in <a href="http://imadeyoursite.com/forceanddestiny/FaD Core book.pdf">Force
    and Destiny</a>.
    Starting Morality score is 50. You may NOT use the
    rule for adjusting Morality to gain starting XP or Credits. However, if you
    have
    taken
    on extra
    Obligation,
    you
    may choose
    to
    adjust your Morality score accordingly.</p>
  <p>4. Any character with an <a href="http://imadeyoursite.com/ageofrebellion/AoE Core Rulebook.pdf">Age
      of Rebellion</a> career takes a Duty score,
    per the rules of that game. You may NOT use the rule for spending Duty to
      gain starting XP or Credits. However, if you have taken on extra Obligation,
      you MUST drop your Duty score accordingly.</p>
  <p>5. Please write a background story. It doesn't have to be a book, but please
    give me at least a few paragraphs about your character. If you purchase any
    Restricted or especially rare items as starting gear, you should talk about
    how they came
    into
    your possession. The background story will be worth some extra XP. </p>
  <p><strong>Other House Rules:</strong></p>
  <p>1. The 3 games use the same core system with a few exceptions. When not
    otherwise covered by a house rule, the newer rules set (Force and Destiny)
    will generally
    win out where there is a disagreement, but common sense must also be applied.
    This is especially true when it comes to using the Force, since Force and
    Destiny was designed around a party of Force Users.</p>
  <p>2. I will allow players to use Dark Force Points, even if they have no Destiny
    Points left to spend. <strong>However, this comes at a cost.</strong> Rules
    as Written (RAW) state that Dark Force Points can be used by spending a Destiny
    Point, taking
    1 Strain per Dark Force Point used, and a conflict score is generated.
    When there are no Destiny Points available, this is not possible. Rather
    than cutting the player off from the Force for that turn, the house rule
    is:
    If
    no
    Destiny
    Points can be spent, the GM will gain a temporary Destiny Point (gets removed
    from play after use, rather than going to the players), plus the Strain cost
    is doubled, and the resulting conflict score is doubled.</p></td>

<tr><th><h3>Character Creation Cheat Sheet</h3></th></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Choose a character sheet:</strong><br>
<a href="Character%20Sheet.pdf">Edge of the Empire Character Sheet</a> (Works
  well if you're keeping notes separately)<br>
    <a href="alternate%20character%20sheet.pdf">Alternate Character and Vehicle
    Sheet</a> (Printer-friendly, incorporates all 3 games)<br>
    <a href="character%20sheet%20extended%2001.pdf">Extended 4-page Character
    Sheet</a> (Very thorough, incorporates all 3 games)<br>
    <a href="character%20sheet%20extended%2002.pdf">Extended 4-page Character
    Sheet Version 2</a> (Less Talent, More Force Power)</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Follow the steps below to create your character:</p>
  <p><strong>1. Choose an <a href="obligation.html">Obligation</a></strong><br>
    This is an aspect of your character's personality or background that can
        come back to haunt you. Choose wisely...</p>
  <p><strong>2. Choose a <a href="species.pdf">Species</a></strong><br>
  Once you pick a species from the list, write down its Characterisitcs and Abilities on your character sheet.</p>
  <p><strong>3. Choose a <a href="careers.html">Career
        and Specialization</a></strong><br>
  You have 18 options for a Career - 6 from each of the 3 CRBs. Your career choice
    is permanent, but you may always purchase Specializations in any Career later
    on. Careers from Edge of the Empire and Age of Rebellion give you 8 Career
    skills (gain a free rank in 4 of them). Careers from
    Force and Destiny give you 6 Careers skills, plus a starting Force Rating
    of 1 (gain a free rank in 3 of them). After you've
    chosen your Career, pick one of the Specializations that belongs to that
    Career as your starting Specialization. Your starting Specialization gives
    you 4
    more Career skills, and allows you to gain a free rank in 2 of them. Each
    Specialization also comes with a Talent Tree.</p>
  <p><strong>4. Invest Starting XP</strong>
  Each Species comes with some Starting XP, which can be spent on advancing your
    character before you begin to play. Use the following chart as a reference
    for spending Starting XP:<br>
    <br>
      <img align="center" src="startingxp.jpg" width="670" height="255">  </p>
  <p><strong>5. Calculate Derived Attributes</strong><br>
  Wound Threshold and Strain Threshold are calculated accoring to your Species abilities. Soak Value starts with your Brawn characteristic, and is increased by your armor and certain talents. Defense usually starts at 0, and can be increased by certain armors or talents.</p>
  <p><strong>6. Choose a Motivation</strong><br>
  Choose a Motivation from one of the CRBs. Pages 94-97 in <a href="EotE%20Core%20Rulebook.pdf">Edge
  of the Empire</a>, Pages 104-108 in <a href="http://imadeyoursite.com/ageofrebellion/AoE Core Rulebook.pdf">Age
  of Rebellion</a>. Pages 105-107 in <a href="http://imadeyoursite.com/forceanddestiny/FaD Core book.pdf">Force
  and Destiny</a>. Playing according to your character's Motivation can earn
  some bonus XP, and may occasionally help you earn a bonus on a roll.</p>
  <p><strong>7. Purchase Starting Gear</strong><br>
  Spend your starting credits on any <a href="weapons.pdf">weapons</a>,
  <a href="armor.html">armor</a>, or other <a href="gear.pdf">gear</a> that
  your character might need. AFTER purchasing all of your starting gear, gain
  1d100
    credits as &quot;pocket change&quot; to begin play (in addition to any of your starting
  credits that were left over).</p>
  <p><strong>8. Write a Backstory</strong><br>
    Give me a summary of your character's life up until now. Try to incorporate
      your Obligation, Motivation, and Career, to make the backstory feel genuine.
      The backstory is worth about 1 session worth of XP that can be spent AFTER
      character creation (meaning it can't be used to raise a Characteristic,
      but it may be used to raise a skill beyond 2 ranks).</p></td>
